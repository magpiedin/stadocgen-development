<h2>Mineralogy Extension</h2>
<p>The Mineralogy extension is an extension to the Darwin Core Model for Mineralogy Collections being developed by the Mineralogy Extension Task Group.</p>
<p>Task Group Homepage: <a href="https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/mineralogy/">https://www.tdwg.org/community/esp/mineralogy/</a></p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>To extend the scope of the TDWG community beyond biology and biological-related knowledge domains, targeted efforts in the form of specialized task groups within the existing TDWG architecture are needed. Within the scope of the ESP interest group, the field of mineralogy is an outlier relative to its paleontological counterpart in terms overlap with biology. As a result, mineralogical collections lack support from the TDWG community and the Darwin Core archive. By expanding TDWG membership to the mineralogical collections community and developing a supplemental extension to the existing Darwin Core Archive for mineralogical collections, the Mineralogy Extension task group will bring mineralogy under the TDWG “umbrella” thereby resolving an identified gap in support to the scientific collections community. This effort will strengthen the TDWG community with a new pool of knowledge and provide the foundation for future efforts by the ESP interest group to extend the Darwin Core standard across all geoscientific fields.</p>
<h3>Goals, outputs and outcomes</h3>
<ol>
<li>Establish a formal set of terms and definitions for mineralogical collections at the specimen level following the Darwin Core model and the best practices of previous successful task groups within TDWG.</li>
<li>Provide a crosswalk between the Mineralogy Extension and the EFG standard (Petersen et al. 2018) that leverages the Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS) schema (SKOS 2009) to describe the conceptual similarities between the two standards (e.g., narrowMatch, exactMatch, closeMatch, etc.).</li>
<li>Develop a supplemental specification that extends the existing Darwin Core Archive to provide direct support for mineralogical collections.</li>
<li>Author a Quick Reference Guide for the Mineralogical Collections Extension that follows the current Darwin Core Quick Reference information model.</li>
</ol>
